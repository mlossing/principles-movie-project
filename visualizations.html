         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Visualization 1: Movie Lengths Over Time, and Correlation to Popularity</h2>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
            <iframe src = "https://mlossing.github.io/principles-movie-project/data_vis_1.html" height = 700 width = 1000 frameBorder = 0></iframe>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>For this visualization, we graphed the length of movies according to their release date, and gave each data point a color on the continuous color scale based on its popularity. As the visualization shows, there has been a slight (but not statistically significant) decrease in the average length of a movie in the past 100 years or so. Furthermore, according to the color scale, there does not appear to be any significant correlation between a movie’s length and its popularity. While a few extra long movie outliers are some of the least popular, we don’t believe these have any significant impact on the overall correlation between a movie’s length and its popularity—audiences seem to equally enjoy short and long movies!</p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Visualization 2: Correlation Between A Movie’s Release Date and its Popularity</h2>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
            <iframe src = "https://mlossing.github.io/principles-movie-project/data_vis_2.html" height = 700 width = 1000 frameBorder = 0></iframe>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>For this visualization, we graphed the release date of movies and compared them to their popularity at the time of data collection. As the visualization shows, there may in fact be a very slight negative correlation between these two factors. While it is certainly evident that our dataset contains many more movies from more recent decades as compared to more distant ones, it also does seem to show a very small decline in a movie’s popularity according to its release date. In short, audiences may tend to prefer older movies to newer ones!</p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Visualization 3: Correlation Between a Movie’s Genre and its Popularity</h2>

         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>For this visualization, we made a graph of the popularity of all of the data in our dataset, and we gave each data point a color according to its movie genre. As the visualization shows, the genre of a movie does not seem to have any significant effect on that movie’s popularity, as all the colors seem to be relatively equal in terms of their position on the y-axis (popularity). It is interesting to note, however, that the “Drama” genre, followed by “Comedy” and then “Action,” are by far the most prominent genres in our dataset. Given our dataset’s large size, this may suggest that most movies made in the past 100 years or so tend to be one of these genres, perhaps implying that these genres reach a wider audience than the others. Therefore, while it seems that moviegoers tend to equally favor all movie genres, it may also be the case that the genres of Drama, Comedy, and Action tend to draw in the largest number of audience members.</p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Visualization 4: Correlation Between A Movie’s Popularity and Whether It Has Won any Awards</h2>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <iframe src = "https://mlossing.github.io/principles-movie-project/data_vis_4.html" height = 700 width = 1000 frameBorder = 0></iframe>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>For this visualization, we used a categories diagram to analyze whether there is any correlation between a movie’s popularity and whether it has won any awards. As the visualization shows, there does seem to be a slight correlation between popularity and awards won—but only in one direction. While it seems to be the case that, as a movie’s popularity increases, so too does the chance that it has won at least one award, the visualization also shows a rather large number of movies which have not been very popular but have still won at least one award. Therefore, we have concluded that, while the most popular movies may be more likely to win an award, some of the least popular movies may also win at least one—perhaps suggesting a disconnect between the interests of audiences and those of film critics.</p>

         <p>Insights
         - Of the 250 most popular movies, it appears that John Wayne has appeared in the most popular movies across the last 100 years
         - The following four actors than compose around 25% of the remaining list: Woody Allen, Glen Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Deniro
         - The rest of the list is highly segmented amongst the remaining actors that make up the 250 most popular movies

         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>Insights:
         - From the demonstrated visualization it becomes clear that the number of movies produced are segmented across a large number of directors, actors, and actresses. However, the actress competitive landscape appears to be less segmented than the actor sector, this could be due to Hollywood being predominantly composed of men for the first 30-40 years, as well as the fact that, even today, Hollywood is slightly more dominated by men than women.

         <p>
         Insights
         - For the top 250 movies by popularity, it appears that John ford and Taylor Ray are responsible for creating around 20% of the 250 most popular movies
         - Well renowned modern directors like Martin Scorsese and Warren Beatty are credited with only creating 2.56% of the top 250 movies each, but this phenomenon could be explained with the fact that the list is composed of movies dating from 1920 to the mid 1990s.
